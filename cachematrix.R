# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of 
# a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The below functions are supposed to cache the inverse of a matrix

## ==================================================================================================================== 
# makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
# retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## ==================================================================================================================== 
# makeCacheMatrix

# This function creates a list of functions to 
# set the value of the matrix
# get the value of the matrix
# set the value of the inverse matrix
# get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL

# cacheSolve

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve 
# should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

# The following function calculates the mean of the matrix created with the above function. 
# However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
# If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value in the cache via the setsolve function.
